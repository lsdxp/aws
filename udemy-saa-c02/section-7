You have provisioned an 8TB gp2 EBS volume and you are running out of IOPS. What is NOT a way to increase performance?
Lecture 0 EBS Volume Types Deep Dive

You would like to leverage EBS volumes in parallel to linearly increase performance, while accepting greater failure risks. Which RAID mode helps you in achieving that?
Lecture 67 EBS RAID configurations

You are running a high-performance database that requires an IOPS of 210,000 for its underlying filesyst
